# Bartik approach: Price elasticity of demand for gasoholes in LMC

Our research explores the price elasticity of demand for G90 and G95 gasoholes in LMC, that is, we analize how consumers respond to price changes and tax policies. To address endogeneity challenges, we use a new instrumental variables approach called Bartik, or Shift Share.

## Cleanning and regressions

In this repository you will find our code used for: data cleanning, data base construction for the development of our paper and the regression models used (MCO, IV and Bartik) with their respective tests and graphs made for empiric analisys.

## Findings

We find that demand for G90 and G95 gasoline is elastic. This means that consuers respond significantly to price-based regulatory policies shoould be affective. We argue that, for most citizens, private transportation is a luxury, so they readily give it up when its price rises as a result of fuel price increases.
